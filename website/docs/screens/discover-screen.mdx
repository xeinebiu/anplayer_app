# Discover Screen

## Search Bar

The Discover screen in AN Player features a versatile **Search Bar** that allows users to search for various types of content, including:

- Audio
- Video
- Artists
- Playlists
- Series
- Movies
- And more

When you perform a search, AN Player will scan **all installed plugins** as well as your **device storage ([Device Content](../setup/device-content))** to deliver comprehensive results.

### Auto Completions

<Row>
    AN Player provides **Auto Completions** as you type in the Search Bar, helping you quickly find relevant content
    by
    suggesting matches based on your input.

</Row>

### URL Scanning

The Search Bar includes a **QR Scanner** feature, accessible via the QR button located on the Search Bar. This allows you to scan URLs quickly and easily.

Alternatively, you can manually paste a URL into the Search Bar and initiate a search. AN Player will automatically attempt to identify the URL using the installed plugins.

### Direct Stream Playback

<Column>
    Both the QR Scanner and manual URL input allow you to play direct streams on AN Player, whether it's an audio or
    video stream.

    To play a direct stream using a manual URL, simply paste the URL into the Search Bar and press the **"Search"**
    button on your keyboard. AN Player will automatically identify and play the stream.

    </Row>

</Column>

## Content

<Column>
    By default, AN Player displays all installed **Plugins** on the Discover screen. The first source shown will be your
    **phone's local content** (if permission is granted by the user).

    Following this, all plugins will sequentially load their feeds onto the Discover screen. You can **scroll
    horizontally** to browse through each plugin's content.

    To explore the content of a specific plugin or source, simply tap on the plugin's **title** (indicated by the right
    chevron icon â–¶). This will allow you to dive deeper into the content offered by that particular plugin.
