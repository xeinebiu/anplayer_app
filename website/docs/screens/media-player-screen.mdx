# Media Player Screen

<Row>
  AN Player offers a rich set of features on the **Media Player Screen**. While
  the interface may seem overwhelming at first due to the number of buttons,
  each one serves a specific purpose. In this section, we’ll guide you through
  each feature to help you get the most out of your media playback experience.

</Row>

### Favorite

<Row>
    <Column>
        The Media Player Screen includes a **"Star" button** on the toolbar, which allows you to toggle the current
        stream as a favorite.

        - A **half-filled star** indicates the stream is **not marked as a favorite**.
        - A **fully filled star** means the stream is **marked as a favorite**.
    </Column>

</Row>

### Audio Focus

<Row>
    <Column>
        The **Audio Focus Button** lets you customize playback behavior to suit your current situation.

        - **Enabled**: AN Player will automatically adjust the playback volume. For instance:
        - Music will mute during phone calls.
        - Volume will lower when audio from another app is playing.
        - **Disabled**: Playback will continue without interruption, regardless of other activities. This is ideal for
        scenarios like recording video with your phone camera while playing audio in the background.
    </Column>

    <Image src="/img/media_player_screen_3.png" alt="Audio Focus Button on Media Player Screen"/>

</Row>

### Sleep Timer

<Column>
    The **Sleep Timer** feature allows you to set AN Player to automatically pause playback at a specific time. Unlike
    other apps that use a countdown timer, AN Player lets you choose the exact time you want playback to stop.

    <Row>
        <Image
            src="/img/media_player_screen_4.png"
            alt="Sleep Timer on Media Player Screen"
        />
        <Image
            src="/img/media_player_screen_5.png"
            alt="Sleep Timer Options on Media Player Screen"
        />
    </Row>

</Column>

### Floating Button

<Column>
    AN Player includes a **Floating Button** that allows you to control playback while using other applications. You can
    pause, resume, skip tracks, or go back to the previous track. To use this feature, overlay permission is required to
    display the floating button on top of other apps.

    <Row>
        <Image
            src="/img/media_player_screen_6.png"
            alt="Floating Button on Media Player Screen"
            width="200"
        />
        <Image
            src="/img/media_player_screen_7.png"
            alt="Floating Button in Action"
            width="200"
        />
        <Image
            src="/img/media_player_screen_8.png"
            alt="Floating Button Overlay Permission"
            width="200"
        />
    </Row>

    Once permission is granted, return to AN Player, and you’ll see the Floating Button. You can drag it to any position
    on the screen and switch to other apps while the button remains in place.

    By holding the Floating Button, you can trigger an expanded state where additional controls are available, such as:

    <Row>
        <Image
            src="/img/media_player_screen_9.png"
            alt="Expanded Floating Button Controls"
        />
        <Image
            src="/img/media_player_screen_10.png"
            alt="Floating Button Dismissal"
        />
    </Row>

    To dismiss the Floating Button, drag it to the bottom-center of the screen or tap the floating button icon on the
    media player screen toolbar.

</Column>

### Local Subtitles

<Column>
    AN Player allows you to load **local subtitles** from your phone directly into the playing stream. The supported
    subtitle formats include:

    - **WebVTT**
    File Extension: `.vtt`
    Mime Type: `text/vtt`

    - **TTML / SMPTE-TT**
    File Extension: `.ttml`
    Mime Type: `application/ttml+xml`

    - **SubRip (SRT)**
    File Extension: `.srt`
    Mime Type: `application/x-subrip`

    - **SubStation Alpha (SSA/ASS)**
    File Extension: `.ssa`, `.ass`
    Mime Type: `text/x-ssa`

    Clicking the **Local Subtitles** button will open the **File Picker**, where you can browse and select the subtitle
    file
    to load into the stream.

    On the example below, we are selecting "4. No Hour.vtt"
