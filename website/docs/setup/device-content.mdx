# Device Content

AN Player supports loading **audio and video files** stored on your device, whether they are located in your phone's internal storage or on an external SD card.

## Grant Storage Permission

<Column>
    <Row>
        To enable AN Player to scan for audio and video files, you need to grant
        **storage permission** the first time you use the app.

    </Row>

    Simply tap the card, and Android will prompt you to grant the necessary permissions.

    <Row>
        <Image src="/img/grant_storage_permission_1.png"/>
        <Image src="/img/grant_storage_permission_2.png"/>
    </Row>

    Once permission is granted, AN Player will display the content from your
    device.
